# Reflections on Feelings and Change

At some point, you grow tired of your own feelings. Some people release their emotions through crying or violence, others drown their sorrows in strong rum at the corner bar, while some simply change their way of life. Our behavior during overload changes as we grow, as our mental and emotional bodies evolve.

As children, we cry; adults shout. But what happens to teenagers? The hardest phase of life is adolescence. In just a few years, we transition from being a child to a fully-grown adult. We are burdened with numerous responsibilities and expectations. It's common to see teens struggling with sleep deprivation, exhaustion, and that ever-present sense of overwhelm. But this isn’t about everyone in general; it’s about me...

## My Journey

Like everyone else, I cried — and kept crying until I was 14. Then something suddenly changed in the way I thought. Maybe it was meant to happen, maybe it was influenced by my actions or the circumstances I was living in. But I can say for sure that something inside me broke. Instead of crying as I always had, I went and punched the wall. I punched until my hands were red.

And you know what? The surge of adrenaline kept me from feeling much pain. I felt relief. It was a cold, snowy winter. Bloodied hands, no problems, no worries. I laughed as I recalled the original cause, drew a little heart on the wall, and wrote the name of the person who had broken me.

## Tradition and Change

After that, punching the wall became a tradition for me. Physical exertion at the gym and broken knuckles — that was my happiness, my shades of emotion that no one could understand. It’s a shame that it didn’t last long. After I began choosing violence over crying, either for myself or others, I changed. I became more abrasive.

When I changed schools, the shift in my social circle brought discomfort, especially when I couldn’t talk to one girl. Imagine: you’ve spent the past year talking to more girls than most adults ever will, and suddenly you hit a barrier that you don’t understand.

## A Turning Point

The situation worsened when I decided to return to the old ways and start crying again. I told my friends I couldn’t talk to her, and that only made things worse. By then, I’d been living on the edge for months. I couldn’t even cry properly — I needed to release the tension somehow.

Then, inevitably, it happened. I snapped. I destroyed the house, broken glass scattered across the hallway, a fist-sized hole in the bathroom door, and a broken doorknob awaited my parents at home. But after all that, I didn’t feel any better. I still needed to cry.

## Acceptance of Change

When I got home, I felt calm. For the first time, I felt truly good. That’s when I made a radical decision: I needed to start talking. I’m not sure if it’s love, sympathy, or disgust. I don’t feel anything for her, and I don’t want any new friends or relationships. But somehow, I find myself with a dry throat when I’m near her.

It’s absurd. She’s not stupid, and she probably wanted to talk too, but we never managed to have a proper conversation. She mumbles, and I respond coldly. Some people say I’m in love, others say I should forget about her. Honestly, I don’t know what others say to her or what she thinks of me. Maybe she feels the same way.

But I’m not writing this because of that. I just want to understand what’s going on here and how to make it stop.
